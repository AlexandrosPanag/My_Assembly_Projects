What is the Assembly language?
----


An assembly language is a programming language that communicates with the hardware of a computer directly. An assembly language allows a software developer to code using words and expressions that can be easier to understand and interpret than the binary or hexadecimal data the computer stores and reads. Assembly languages often serve as intermediaries, allowing for developing more complex programming languages, which can offer further efficiency to a developer.

Some professional industries still use assembly language when creating programs or functions. For example, some financial firms and marketplaces use high-frequency trading (HFT) platforms, which developers write in assembly language. By having the only processor translate from an assembly code, these professionals can save processing time other firms may spend on the additional translation from a higher-level code.
