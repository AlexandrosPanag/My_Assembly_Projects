What is MIPS Assembly?
-----
MIPS assembly language simply refers to the assembly language of the MIPS processor. The term MIPS is an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. It is a reduced-instruction set architecture developed by an organization called MIPS Technologies.

The MIPS assembly language is a very useful language to learn because many embedded systems run on the MIPS processor. Knowing how to code in this language brings a deeper understanding of how these systems operate on a lower level.
